The RISC-V ISA is a open standard instruction set which is free and uses a open license. The license allows for development of closed and opensource implemenations for commercial and non-commercial use.

A reduced instruction set computer (RISC) `?????????'


Instruction set architecture (ISA) defines the the instructions which the architecture must support. A ISA also specifies instructions for handling data and memory operations, and how data id encoded in the registers.

The RISC-V ISA has modular design with different ISA bases which defines instructions for integers and weak memory ordering, and a number of extensions developed in a collective efforts with researchers and companies.
A modular approach allows the implementors to disable extension which is not needed, and save money on space and power used. 
Extensions are activeley being developed, with some being in a "frozen" state. Which is defined as not expected to change during the ratification proccess.

A company might not find the extensions they need for their product. In that situation a custom ISA extension can be used, to add their special instructions. 
This dosent break the compliance with the main specification, which means that software made for the main specification will still work on the extended ISA.
