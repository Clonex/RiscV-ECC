A essential part of computing is having a secure cryptographic algoritm. Theese algoritms has become a crucial part of messaging, and network systems.
The goal of this project is to port Curve25519 to RISC-V, and optimize it for the VexRiscv platform.
\\
Curve25519 is a elliptic cure algoritm released by Daniel J. Bernstein in 2005. The algorithm was originally defined as a Diffie-Hellman function.
ECC uses smaller keys than RSA while providing the same level of security, with faster key generation.
A ECC public key contains a pair of integer coordinates \textit{(x, y)} on the curve. A elliptic point can be compressed to a single X coordinate, which is used by curve 25519.
\\
The Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman is a key agreement scheme, which allows two parties to establish a shared secret with 2 different public/private key sets. 
Eliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is very similar to a classical Diffie Hellman, the difference is that ECDH uses \textit{ECC point multiplication} where the classical approach uses \textit{modular exponentations}.
