The goal of this project was to port was to setup a simulation of the RISC-V ISA using the platform
VexRiscv. Then port a reference implementation of Curve22519 to this platform, and optimize and evaluate the optimizations. \\
A small optimization to the multiplication arithmetic was the only thing implemented due to time constraints. The Karatsuba algorithm implemented is only a nominally amount faster compared to the reference implementation. This could however be a good foundation for further optimizations, or other kinds of multiplication algorithms. A lot of time was used to understand what exactly was going on, and how everything works together in the reference implementation.\\
It is difficult to determine the correctness of the changes due to the scope of the project, but does seem like it works as intended from the testing and comparisons that has been done with the reference implementation.\\
The overall project was successful, even though it wasn't significant improvements in cycles.
